        Strucutres compared to arrays are more effective at storing multiple
types of data. It creates more of an object where it has defualt values that
can be modified within the program or assigned. Compared to an array where it
is a list of different elements of all the same type to be modified. A Struct 
can hold arrays as well. Struct are much more useful at sending massive amounts
of data into another function and modify/make us of the information. Arrays can
do a similar thing but are limited to one data type.
        Arrays on the other hand are much easier to use and call upon. Being
able to be modified and called up just as easy. Arrays are much more effective
at using massive amounts of data of all the similar and modifying it. Arrays 
can not be returned however any modifications within a function are returned to
the array. You can return structs or do it by address where it works 
exactly the same as an array.
